- 👋 Hi, I’m @Prog-Pilot
- 👀 I’m interested in getting back to programming after (many) years of managing software and hardware projects but not writing a single line of code. Well, some stuff for personal use, learning and enjoyment. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning node.js and javascript while recalling my skills on COBOL. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any COBOL project or any project where my '80s and '90s software engineer skills could be useful.
- 📫 You can reach me at the email address: manel.sanchez-m@outlook.com
